# slopware
A list of software created/affected by the usage of LLMs.

# Why?
AI (or LLMs) in general has a lot of issues beyond just misinformation problem.

It is also spreading around in software so i thought about creating a simple repo dedicated to listing off which software is currently affected by it so that anyone coming across this repo may be aware about it.

# Browsers
| Name | Evidence | Alternatives |
| :------- | :------: | -------: |
| Google Chrome  | It's literally [advertised as one of their main selling points](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Later versions seems to plan including more AI.  | see below  |
| Firefox  | [Blog post showing evidences](https://alextheward.com/blog/mozilla_is_now_an_ai_company/).   | see below  |
| Floorp (Firefox fork)  | [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp/discussions/1630). Also has a [MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/floorp-mcp-server).   | see below  |

### Alternatives
* **ungoogled-chromium (Chromium fork)** removes ai stuff like Gemini (Chromium may still have AI sadly so it's not really an alternative).
* **Librewolf (Firefox fork)** also [fights](https://chaos.social/@librewolf/115716906957137196) against AI features.
* **Vivaldi** openly [states](https://vivaldi.com/blog/keep-exploring/) that there will be no AI features in their browser.

# Operating systems
| Name | Evidence | Alternatives |
| :------- | :------: | -------: |
| Windows (11 post-23H2)  | Copilot is almost everywhere in the system in Windows 11 including even the simplest apps like Notepad (there's also Recall feature for certain devices).  | Linux probably  |
